# Amazon_Dashboard

ðŸš€ The Amazon Sales Intelligence System

RED ALERT: Amazon doesn't need reports. It needs surgical profit.

This model isn't a fancy chart. It's your secret weapon to dissect billions in transactions and extract actual value. 

It answers the only question that matters: HOW DO WE MULTIPLY REVENUE WHILE CUTTING WASTE?

It links gross turnover (fact_sales and its Total_sales_2023/2024 metrics) to the profit levers:

âœ… The Who (dim_customer): Pinpoint the exact Market Segment, Customer Type, Gender, and Birth Date driving the biggest baskets. Stop targeting everyone.

âœ… The What (dim_product): Know which Product Category and Weight (why pay for shipping on a product that doesn't sell?) are gold mines... and which are dead weight.

âœ… The Where/When (dim_region / dim_date): Locate the precise Continent and Day of the Week where your campaigns hit peak profitability.

This isn't analysis; it's market surgery. Use this structure to focus investment where the return is guaranteed. 

That is how you achieve true e-commerce domination.
